One Millionth Derivative in Calculus

Code generated by LLaVA AI.
This program uses a for loop to calculate the derivative at each integer from 1 to M (1 million). It uses the recursive formula for derivatives, which is:
d(n+1) = d(n) + (n+1) * f(n+1) / f(n)
where d(n) is the derivative at n, f(n) is the function being differentiated, and f(n+1) is the derivative of f(n).
In this case, the function being differentiated is x^2, so f(n) = x^n and f(n+1) = 2x^n. Plugging these into the formula, we get:
d(n+1) = d(n) + (n+1) * 2x^n / x^n
which simplifies to:
d(n+1) = d(n) + 2x^(n+1)
This is the formula used in the for loop to calculate the derivative at each integer from 1 to M. The final result is the millionth derivative of x^2, which is printed to the console.
